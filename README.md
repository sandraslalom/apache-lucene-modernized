# Apache Lucene - Modernized Edition

This is a modernized version of Apache Lucene that leverages the latest Java features and best practices while maintaining compatibility and performance.

## üöÄ Modernization Highlights

### Language Features
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**: Utilizes modern switch expressions and pattern matching
- **Records Integration**: Appropriate data classes converted to records where beneficial
- **Sealed Classes**: Type hierarchies enhanced with sealed classes for better type safety
- **Text Blocks**: Multi-line strings replaced with text blocks for better readability
- **Optional API**: Null-safe APIs using Optional where appropriate
- **Stream API Enhancements**: Modern collection processing with enhanced streams

### Concurrency Improvements
- **Virtual Threads**: Leverages Project Loom's virtual threads for improved scalability
- **Structured Concurrency**: Modern concurrency patterns for better resource management
- **Enhanced Concurrent Collections**: Updated concurrent data structures

### Performance Optimizations
- **Vector API**: Integration with incubator Vector API for numerical computations
- **Modern GC**: Optimized for ZGC and other modern garbage collectors
- **Memory Efficiency**: Improved memory usage patterns with modern Java features

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Better tooling integration and debugging capabilities
- **Improved Error Messages**: More descriptive error messages and diagnostics
- **Modern Build System**: Enhanced Gradle configuration with latest features
- **Comprehensive Testing**: JUnit 5, property-based testing, and mutation testing

## üìã System Requirements

- **Java**: 23 or later (with preview features enabled)
- **Build Tool**: Gradle 8.5+
- **Memory**: Minimum 2GB RAM for building
- **OS**: Any platform supporting Java 23

## üõ†Ô∏è Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sandraslalom/apache-lucene-modernized.git
cd apache-lucene-modernized

# Build with modern features
./gradlew build --enable-preview

# Run tests with virtual threads
./gradlew test -Djava.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism=8

# Generate documentation
./gradlew javadoc
```

## üîß Key Modernization Changes

### 1. Document Class Enhancements
- Added `Stream<IndexableField> stream()` method for functional programming
- Introduced `Optional<T>` variants for null-safe field access
- Enhanced with utility methods like `hasField()`, `isEmpty()`, `size()`
- Deprecated null-returning methods in favor of Optional variants

### 2. BytesRef Improvements
- Enhanced with modern switch expressions in `equals()` method
- Added factory methods: `of(String)`, `of(byte[])`, `of(byte[], int, int)`
- New utility methods: `isEmpty()`, `byteAt(int)`, `toByteArray()`
- Improved null safety with `Objects.requireNonNull()`

### 3. Build System Modernization
- Enhanced Gradle configuration with modern plugins
- Virtual threads and Vector API integration
- Advanced security scanning and dependency checking
- Performance benchmarking and profiling tools
- Enhanced parallel build support

### 4. Testing Framework Updates
- JUnit 5 platform integration
- Testcontainers for integration testing
- Property-based testing support
- Mutation testing for code quality
- Enhanced test reporting and parallel execution

## üîí Security Enhancements

- Comprehensive dependency vulnerability scanning
- Enhanced input validation patterns
- Secure coding practices implementation
- Regular security audit integration

## üìä Performance Improvements

- Vector API integration for numerical operations
- Virtual threads for improved concurrency
- Modern garbage collection optimizations
- Enhanced memory usage patterns
- Parallel processing improvements

## üß™ Testing

The modernized version includes comprehensive testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test

# Run performance benchmarks
./gradlew performanceBenchmark

# Run security scans
./gradlew securityScan

# Run mutation tests
./gradlew mutationTest
```

## üìö Documentation

Enhanced documentation includes:
- Modern API documentation with HTML5
- Interactive tutorials and examples
- Performance tuning guides
- Migration documentation
- Best practices guide

## üîÑ Migration Guide

### From Original Lucene

1. **Null Safety**: Replace null checks with Optional usage
2. **Stream Processing**: Leverage new stream methods for collection processing
3. **Pattern Matching**: Update instanceof chains to use pattern matching
4. **Build Configuration**: Update to use modernized Gradle configuration

### Example Migration

**Before:**
```java
String value = document.get("field");
if (value != null) {
    // process value
}
```

**After:**
```java
document.getOptional("field")
    .ifPresent(value -> {
        // process value
    });
```
